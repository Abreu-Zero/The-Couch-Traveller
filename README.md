the-couch-traveller
===================

small iOS app that allows you to travel around without leaving the couch - or at least see some pictures, idk im not instagram

Why?
------

This is a simple app that helped me better understand persistent data with CoreData using a somewhat complex model and to improve my network requests skills.

* Uses URLSessions to interact with a public restful API
* Stores media on the device file system
* Uses CoreData for local persistence

Requirements:
------------
*from Udacity's Nanodegree*

**App Specification: Virtual Tourist**

This app allows users specify travel locations around the world, and create virtual photo albums for each location. 
The locations and photo albums will be stored in Core Data.
The app will have at least two view controller scenes.
Travel Locations Map View: Allows the user to drop pins around the world
Photo Album View: Allows the users to download and edit an album for a location

How?
----

Just clone it and you are ready to build at xcode, please let me know what you think!
